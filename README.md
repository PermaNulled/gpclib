# gpclib
A script upload/viewing system integrated inside of a wordpress front-end, could easily be adapted to a code sharing repository.

An example of this system in-use can be seen here: http://cronusmax.com/gpclib/ 

The uploaded version currently links user accounts to the forum, and grabs those sessions, it also includes some hard-coded paths and was not originally made to be distributed.
